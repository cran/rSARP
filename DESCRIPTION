Description: Tools to create, evaluate, critique,
    revise, track progress, and communicate a detailed wilderness or urban
    search plan to management. This package uses and creates csv files in the R
    working directory to document inputs and results. It also creates a series
    of PDF and PNG files to accomplish communication of the plan. The program
    creates and revises search plans using Bayesian models. The package
    includes functions bestsearch(), searchstatus() and searchme() to model the
    number of searchers and hours required to search an area, calculate the
    probability of detection, probability of success, and project the best plan
    given limited resources.
